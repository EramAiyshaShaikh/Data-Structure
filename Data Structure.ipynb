What are data structures, and why are they important?**\n","- Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.\n","- Data Structures are important because they provide efficiency,organization and management,code readability,memory management\n","- Python offers a variety of built-in data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, each suited for different use cases. Additionally, more complex data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs can be implemented using Python's object-oriented features. Understanding and effectively utilizing these data structures is fundamental for writing robust, scalable, and efficient Python applications.\n","\n","**2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples**\n","- Mutable: Mutable is when something is changeable or has the ability to change. In Python, ‘mutable’ is the ability of objects to change their values. These are often the objects that store a collection of data.\n","  - Example:\n","    ##### dictionary is mutable\n","    my_dict = {\"name\": \"Ram\", \"age\": 25}\n","    new_dict = my_dict\n","    new_dict[\"age\"] = 37\n","    print(my_dict)   \n","    print(new_dict)\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    {'name': 'Ram', 'age': 37}\n","    {'name': 'Ram', 'age': 37}\n","- Immutable: Immutable is the when no change is possible over time. In Python, if the value of an object cannot be changed over time, then it is known as immutable. Once created, the value of these objects is permanent.\n","  - Example: Since strings are immutable an error message will display\n","    ##### strings are immutable\n","    message = \"Welcome to GeeksforGeeks\"\n","    message[0] = 'p'\n","    print(message)\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    message[0] = 'p'\n","    TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n","\n","**3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python**\n","- In Python, lists and tuples both store collections of data, but differ in mutability\n","- Lists can be modified, meaning their elements can be changed, added or removed after creation.\n","  - Example: a = [1, 2, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 6, 5]\n","    ##### Modifying an element in the list 'a'\n","    a[3] = 77\n","    print(a)\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    [1, 2, 4, 77, 3, 3, 3, 6, 5]\n","- Tuples cannot be modified after creation. Any attempt to change an element will result in an error.\n","  - Example: b = (0, 1, 2, 3)\n","    ##### Attempting to modify a tuple\n","    b[0] = 4\n","    print(b)  \n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    b[0] = 4\n","    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment  \n","\n","**4. Describe how dictionaries store data**\n","- Python dictionary is a data structure that stores the value in key: value pairs. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can't be repeated and must be immutable.\n","  - Example: Here, The data is stored in key:value pairs in dictionaries, which makes it easier to find values.\n","\n","    d = {1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}\n","    print(d)\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    {1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}\n","\n","**5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python**\n","- In Python, both sets and lists are used to store collections of elements but they have key differences that make them suitable for different use cases. The main difference is that lists are ordered, meaning the order of elements is preserved and they can be accessed by their index while sets are unordered meaning they do not maintain the order of elements and automatically ensure all elements are unique.\n","  - Example:\n","    ##### Creating a set\n","    s1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n","    s2 = set([4, 5, 6, 7])\n","\n","    print(s1)       \n","    print(s2)\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    {1, 2, 3, 4}\n","    {4, 5, 6, 7}\n","- Uniqueness of Elements in Seta:\n","  Sets inherently store only unique elements. If you need a collection where duplicate values are not allowed, a set automatically handles this by preventing the addition of identical items. Lists, conversely, allow duplicates.\n","\n","**6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list**\n","- A string is a sequence of characters. Python treats anything inside quotes as a string. This includes letters, numbers, and symbols. Python has no character data type so single character is a string of length 1.\n","  - Example:\n","    Strings can be created using either single (') or double (\") quotes.\n","    s1 = 'GfG'\n","    s2 = \"GfG\"\n","    print(s1)\n","    print(s2)\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    GfG\n","    GfG\n","- Mutable vs. Immutable: A list is mutable, meaning you can modify its elements after it is created. On the other hand, a string is immutable, which means you cannot change its characters once it is created. Instead, you need to create a new string with the desired modifications.\n","  - Example:\n","    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","    my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n","    ##### Modifying a list\n","    my_list[2] = 5\n","    print(my_list)\n","    ##### Output: [1, 2, 5, 4]\n","    ##### Attempting to modify a string will result in an error\n","    my_string[2] = 'x'\n","    ##### Raises TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment    \n","\n","**7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python**\n","- Tuples are an essential data structure in Python, representing an immutable, ordered collection of elements. They are similar to lists but with a key difference: once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be changed. This immutability makes tuples a reliable choice for storing fixed collections of data.\n","- Tuples are commonly used when you want to group related pieces of information together. They ensure that the group of information stays unchanged throughout your program.\n","- Tuples are faster than Lists in Python in execution and are used based on its requirements where we need immutable and fast execution. The immutability of tuple ensures data integrity.  \n","  - Example: The information cannot be changed\n","\n","    b = (0, 1, 2, 3)\n","    ##### Attempting to modify a tuple\n","    b[0] = 4\n","    print(b)\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    b[0] = 4\n","    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n","\n","**8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python**\n","- A Hash Table in Python utilizes an array as a medium of storage and uses the hash method to create an index where an element is to be searched from or needs to be inserted. In other words, a Hash Table in Python is a data structure which stores data by using a pair of values and keys\n","- In Python, the Dictionary data types represent the implementation of hash tables. The Keys in the dictionary are hashable–they are generated by a hash function which generates a unique result for each unique value supplied to the hash function.\n","- Python has a built-in function to generate the hash of an object, the hash() function. This function takes an object as input and returns the hash as an integer.\n","- Since dictionaries are built on top of hash tables, you can only insert an element if its key is hashable. If the key of your element is not hashable (like a list, for example), the interpreter throws an TypeError exception:\n","  - Example:\n","    \n","    my_list = [\"Giri\", \"Mamedyarov\"]\n","    chess_players[my_list] = 2764\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n","\n","**9. Can lists contain different data types in Python**\n","-  In Python, lists can contain heterogeneous data types and objects. For instance, integers, strings, and even functions can be stored within the same list. Different elements of a list can be accessed by integer indices where the first element of a list has the index of 0. This property derives from the fact that in Python, lists are ordered, which means they retain the order in which you insert the elements into the list.\n","  - Example:\n","\n","    list1 = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","    list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]\n","    list3 = [True, False, False]\n","\n","    print(list1)\n","    print(list2)\n","    print(list3)\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n","    [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]\n","    [True, False, False]\n","\n","\n","**10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python**\n","- Strings in Python are \"immutable\" which means they can not be changed after they are created. Some other immutable data types are integers, float, boolean, etc.\n","\n","- The immutability of Python string is very useful as it helps in hashing, performance optimization, safety, ease of use, etc.\n","  - Example:\n","    \n","    name_1 = \"Aarun\"\n","    name_1[0] = 'T'\n","\n","    OUTPUT: TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n","- Immutability ensures one reference does not change the value for others pointing to the same string. Security: Strings are used for sensitive data like usernames and passwords. Immutability prevents attackers from altering the values.    \n","\n","**11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks**\n","- Lists and Dictionaries in Python are inbuilt data structures that are used to store data. Lists are linear in nature whereas dictionaries stored the data in key-value pairs.\n","- A Python dictionary is a data structure that stores the value in key: value pairs. Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can't be repeated and must be immutable.\n","  - Example:\n","\n","    ##### Creating a Dictionary with Integer Keys\n","    Dict = {1: 'John', 2: 'Peter', 3: 'Nolan'}\n","    print(\"Dictionary with the use of Integer Keys: \", Dict)\n","    ##### Accessing particular elements\n","    print(Dict[1])\n","    print(Dict[2])\n","    ##### Creating a Dictionary with Mixed keys\n","    Dict = {'Name': 'John', 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]}\n","    print(\"\\nDictionary with the use of Mixed Keys: \", Dict)\n","    ##### Accessing particular elements\n","    print(Dict['Name'])\n","    print(Dict[1])\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    Dictionary with the use of Integer Keys:  {1: 'John', 2: 'Peter', 3: 'Nolan'}\n","    John\n","    Peter\n","    Dictionary with the use of Mixed Keys:  {'Name': 'John', 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]}\n","    John\n","    [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","- Dictionaries provide faster lookups compared to lists when searching by key, as they have an average complexity of O(1), while lists require O(n) in the worst case.\n","- For large-scale searches and deletions, dictionaries outperform lists.    \n","\n","**12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list**\n","- In Python, tuples are generally preferred over lists in the following scenarios:\n","  - Immutability: Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation. This makes them suitable for representing fixed collections of items where you want to ensure that the data remains constant. For example, using a tuple to represent coordinates (x, y) ensures that these values cannot be altered accidentally.\n","  - Performance: Tuples can be more memory-efficient and faster than lists for certain operations since they have a smaller memory overhead due to their immutability. If you need a collection of items that doesn't change, using a tuple can lead to better performance.\n","  - Hashability: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets because they are hashable (as long as their elements are hashable). Lists, on the other hand, cannot be used in these contexts due to their mutability.\n","  - Semantic Meaning: When the data represents a fixed structure or a record, tuples can provide clearer semantics. For example, using a tuple to represent a database record (like (id, name, age)) can convey that the data structure is intended to be a fixed, non-changing set of values.\n","  - Multiple Return Values: Tuples are commonly used to return multiple values from a function. This makes it clear that the function is returning a fixed number of related values.\n","  - Example:\n","    ##### Using a tuple to represent a 2D point\n","    point = (3, 5)\n","    ##### Attempting to change a value (will raise an error)\n","    ##### point[0] = 10  # This would raise a TypeError\n","    ##### Using a tuple as a dictionary key\n","    point_dict = {point: \"A point in 2D space\"}\n","    ##### Using a list for mutable collections\n","    mutable_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","    mutable_list.append(4)  # Lists can be changed\n","\n","**13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python**\n","- Python sets fundamentally do not allow duplicate values. They are designed to store only unique elements.\n","- When attempting to add a duplicate element to a set, the set simply ignores the addition; it does not raise an error, and the existing element remains in the set without any change or addition of the duplicate.\n","- This characteristic makes sets highly useful for operations requiring unique collections of items, such as removing duplicates from a list or performing mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.\n","  - Example:\n","    my_set = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4}\n","    print(my_set)\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    {1, 2, 3, 4}\n","\n","**14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries**\n","- The in and not in operator works on dictionaries; it tells you whether something appears or not as a key in the dictionary. It returns two values True or False.\n","- The in operator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. For lists, it uses a search algorithm. As the list gets longer, the search time gets longer in direct proportion. For dictionaries, Python uses an algorithm called a hashtable that has a remarkable property: the in operator takes about the same amount of time no matter how many items there are in a dictionary.\n","- The in operation for the dictionary tests on keys. The key of the dictionary is a unique value as well as the set, and the execution time is about the same as for sets. On the other hand, dictionary values can be duplicated like a list\n","\n","**15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not**\n","- Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that you cannot change, add, or remove items once the tuple is created.\n","- But there are some workarounds. You can convert the tuple into a list, change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple.\n","  - Example:\n","    x = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n","    y = list(x)\n","    y[1] = \"kiwi\"\n","    x = tuple(y)\n","    print(x)\n","\n","    OUTPUT:\n","    (\"apple\", \"kiwi\", \"cherry\")\n","\n","\n","**16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case**\n","- In Python, a nested dictionary is a dictionary inside a dictionary. It's a collection of dictionaries into one single dictionary.\n","  - Example:\n","    nested_dict = { 'dictA': {'key_1': 'value_1'},\n","                    'dictB': {'key_2': 'value_2'}}\n","- Use Cases:\n","  - Storing complex data:\n","    Nested dictionaries are ideal for representing data with multiple layers of organization, such as employee records, product catalogs, or even game data.\n","  - Representing hierarchical relationships:\n","    The nested structure allows you to easily model parent-child relationships or categories and subcategories.\n","  - JSON data:\n","    Nested dictionaries map naturally to the structure of JSON data, making them useful when working with APIs or web services that return JSON responses.\n","  - Configuration files:\n","    You can represent complex configuration settings using nested dictionaries, where keys represent different sections or modules and values are dictionaries containing specific settings.                     \n","\n","**17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary**\n","- Python dictionaries provide a fast and efficient way to store and retrieve data using key value pair so understanding the time complexities of dictionary operations is very important for optimizing performance in our programs.\n","- The time complexity of retrieving a value by its key in a dictionary is O(1). This is because dictionaries use a hash table internally which allows constant time lookup.\n","  - Example:\n","    ##### Create a dictionary\n","    dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n","    ##### Access value by key\n","    val = dict['b']\n","    print(val)\n","\n","**18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries**\n","- If you need an ordered collection, like a sequence of user actions, lists are your go-to. On the other hand, when you need quick look-ups, like mapping usernames to user data, dictionaries are invaluable.\n","- Use a list when:\n","  1. Order Matters: You need to maintain the order of elements, as lists are ordered collections.\n","  2. Indexed Access: You want to access elements by their position (index) in the collection.\n","  3. Iterating: You need to frequently iterate over a sequence of items.\n","  4. Homogeneous Data: You are storing a collection of similar items (e.g., numbers, strings).\n","\n","**19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data  retrieval**\n","- Dictionary is a data structure which is a important value structure, optimized for fast storage and recovery based on key.\n","- In python, dictionaries are un-ordered because Python dictionaries are not intended to be in order, as simple as that. If we want to collect a set of objects in order, we have only one choice of accessing them: through index.\n","\n","**20.  Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.**\n","- A list is an ordered collection of items, whereas a dictionary is an unordered data collection in a key: value pair. Elements from the list can be accessed using the index, while the elements of the dictionary can be accessed using keys.\n","- The list allows duplicate items, while the dictionary does not allow any duplicate keys.\n","- A list can store any data type. In contrast, keys in the dictionary can be of any immutable data type, and values can be of any data type.\n","- Lists perform faster for ordered operations like sorting, while dictionaries perform faster for lookup operations."],"metadata":{"id":"rdJx7bKPMq4n"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"9nmVzrQGMl9j"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#PRACTICAL QUESTIONS"],"metadata":{"id":"DAQppaFgDutO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["### 1.
